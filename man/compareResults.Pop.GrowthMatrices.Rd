\description{
Function to compare growth matrices among several model runs using bubble plots.
}
\details{
If multiple models are compared, then a set of bubble plots
are created faceted by mode case (row) and sex (column).
If a single model is plotted, then bubble plots are created faceted by sex (row). One ggplot
object is returned as a named list, with the figure caption as the name.
