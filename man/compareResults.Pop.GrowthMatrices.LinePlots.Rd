\description{
Function to compare growth matrices among several model runs using line plots.
}
\details{
The line plots are faceted by pre-molt size. If multiple models are compared, then sex-specific plots are
created, with individual lines corresponding to different models. If a single model is plotted, the
different sexes are plotted using different colors on the same faceted plots.
