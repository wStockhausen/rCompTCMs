\usage{
compareFits.BiomassData(
  objs = NULL,
  fleets = "all",

\arguments{
\item{fleets}{- names of fleets to include (or "all")}

\item{fleet.type}{- fleet type ('fishery' or 'survey')}

\item{catch.type}{- catch type ('index','retained',  or 'total')}

\item{ci}{- confidence interval for plots}

\item{scales}{- ggplot2 scales option for facet_grid}

\item{position}{- indicates ggplot2 position_ to use ('dodge','jitter','identity',)}

\item{pdf}{- name for output pdf file}

\item{showPlot}{- flag (T/F) to show plot}

\item{verbose}{- flag (T/F) to print diagnostic information}

\item{obj}{- object that can be converted into a list of tcsam2013.resLst and/or tcsam02.resLst objects, OR a melted dataframe}
}
\value{
Non-nested list of ggplot2 objects, with captions as names, or NULL.
}
\description{
Function to compare fits to biomass time series by fleet among
several model runs.
}
\details{
If \code{objs} is a list, then [extractMDFR.Fits.BiomassData()] is used to extract a melted dataframe
in canonical format with the biomass observations and predictions to be plotted. \code{objs} can also be a melted
dataframe from a previous call to [extractMDFR.Fits.BiomassData()].
Also uses [wtsUtilities::printGGList()].
