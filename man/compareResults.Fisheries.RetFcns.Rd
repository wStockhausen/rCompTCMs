\usage{
compareResults.Fisheries.RetFcns(

  years = "all",
  dodge = 0.2,

\arguments{
\item{objs}{- list of resLst objects}

\item{cast}{- formula to exclude factors from "averaging" over}

\item{fleets}{- vector of feets to plot, or "all"}

\item{years}{- vector of years to show, or 'all' to show all years}

\item{dodge}{- width to dodge overlapping series}

\item{mxy}{- max number of years per page}

\item{singlePlot}{- flag to plot all years on single plot (be sure to adjust facet_grid)}

\item{facet_wrap}{- ggplot2 formula to produce figure with wrapped facets}

\item{facet_grid}{- ggplot2 formula to produce figure with gridded facets}

\item{showPlot}{- flag (T/F) to show plot}

\item{pdf}{- creates pdf, if not NULL}

\item{verbose}{- flag (T/F) to print diagnostic information}
}
\value{
lists of ggplot2 objects, nested by fishery or an empty list if year is NULL
}
