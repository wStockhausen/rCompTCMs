\title{Function to extract estimated population abundance by year among several models as a dataframe}
\usage{
extractMDFR.Pop.Abundance(objs, cast = "y+x", years = "all", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{objs}{\itemize{
\item list of resLst objects
}}

\item{cast}{\itemize{
\item casting formula for excluding y,x,m,s,z factor levels from sums across the unspecified factors
}}

\item{years}{\itemize{
\item 'all' or vector of years to include
}}

\item{verbose}{\itemize{
\item flag (T/F) to print diagnostic information
}}
}
\value{
dataframe in canonical format
}
\description{
This function extracts estimated population abundance by year
among several models as a dataframe.
}
\details{
Results are extracted using \code{rTCSAM2013::getMDFR.Pop.Abundance},
\code{rsimTCSAM::getMDFR.Pop.Abundance}, and/or \code{rTCSAM02::getMDFR.Pop.Abundance}, as appropriate, and
cast to aggregate. This differs from \code{extractMDFR.Pop.Abundance1}.
